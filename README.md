# GenericCheckpointing

- Implemented Java Reflection using Strategy Pattern. 
- Created a generic library to serialize and deserialize objects. 
- This project allows the conversion of objects into a wire format. 
- Code is designed using dynamic proxies and reflection so that addition of new objects or serialization formats causes minimal changes (reduces the ripple effect).
